## Key Observations
1. Claude models (particularly 3.5 Sonnet and 3.7 Sonnet) show the most consistent and advanced capabilities for Angular modernization.
2. GPT models demonstrate strong performance, especially in the latest versions.
3. Gemini 2.0 Flash provides good baseline capabilities but lags slightly in deep Angular-specific transformations.

## Recommended Model
For Angular code modernization, the recommended models are:
1. Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Top Recommendation)
2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet
3. GPT-4.5

## Considerations
- Always validate AI-generated transformations
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage during modernization
- Use these models as assistive tools, not complete replacement for human expertise
